# Binary search Tree
This project is about data structure Binary Search Tree.
In binary Search Tree, nodes are arranged in specific order with following properties:
1. The elements that are present in left side of the tree are less than or equal to the root node.
2. The elements that are present in right side of the tree are greater than the root node.

## Languague
This project is developed by using Java.

## Operations performed in tree
* Insertion - Adding elements to the tree based on the property.
* Search - Finding specific element in the tree whether that element is present or not in tree.

## Traversing Techniques
There are two techniques:
1. Breadth First Search
2. Depth First Search 
In **Breadth First Search**, there are three types: 
Inorder : It follows - Left,Root,Right 
Preorder : It follows - Root,Left,Right
PostOrder : It follows - Left,Right,Root

In **Depth First Search**, Tree is tranversed based on levels from top to bottom.
First root, then next level of tree traversed from left side to right side.It will be continued till all levels are traversed.

* Performed git operations, to push code from local to remote.
